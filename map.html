                    <p class="para1">
                        Team Rainbow has been called to raid a major bank. The focus is on providing a sense of progression for attackers as they make their way through progressively more fortified areas of the building.</p></li>

            <p class="para1"> Location: MIDDLE EAST
                <p class="para1">
                        Team Rainbow has been called in to assist the local law enforcement and regain control of the border. A mix of old and new buildings with open air pathways make this the most destructible and open planned map to date.</p></li> -->

                <p class="para1"> Location: LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM
                    <p class="para1">
                        This presidential plane offers an exotic and unique siege experience. It is claustrophobic, tense and constrained, involving limited breaching opportunities and sight lines.</p></li>

                <p class="para1"> Location: BAFFIN BAY
                    <p class="para1">
                        In the Baffin Bay, a luxury yacht has crashed into an iceberg breaching the hull. Rainbow has been sent to secure the stranded vessel as an unidentified submarine has docked near the vessel.</p></li>

                    <p class="para1">
                        Team Rainbow has been called to neutralize a Yakuza war brewing high above the streets of Nagoya, Japan. Perched on top of Skyscraper, you will explore refined works of Japanese architecture inside a dangerous mansion. Be prepared for vertiginous rappels in the haze of the morning sun, where modernity and tradition meet.</p></li>

                <p class="para1"> Location: BRAZIL
                    <p class="para1">
                        Team Rainbow has been called to pacify and regain control of the Favela. Mixing colorful and narrow streets with high vantage points, this map supports exterior shell destruction which renders it as the most destructible to date.</p></li> -->
